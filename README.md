# CIFAR-10 Image Classification

This project demonstrates image classification using CNNs and Transfer Learning (VGG16) on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

##  Features
- Implemented CNN and fine-tuned VGG16
- Applied Data Augmentation and Batch Normalization
- Used EarlyStopping callback to prevent overfitting
- Visualized training performance and confusion matrix

##  Results
- Accuracy: **87.4%**
- Loss curves and confusion matrix are available in the `results/` folder.

##  Tools
Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
